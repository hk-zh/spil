[<b>What Matters in Language Conditioned Imitation Learning</b>](https://arxiv.org/pdf/foo.pdf)

 We present **HULC** (**H**ierarchical **U**niversal **L**anguage **C**onditioned Policies), an end-to-end model that can 
 learn  a wide variety of language conditioned robot skills from  offline free-form imitation datasets. HULC sets a new state of the art on the challenging CALVIN benchmark, 
 on learning a single 7-DoF policy that can perform long-horizon manipulation tasks in a 3D environment, directly from images, and only specified with natural language.
This code accompanies the paper What Matters in Language Conditioned Imitation Learning, which can be found here. 
We hope the code will be useful as a starting point for further research on language conditioned policy learning and will bring us closer towards general-purpose robots that can relate human language to their perception and actions.
